# Snake-Game 
A simple snake game using the SFML graphics library. 
  
Through this project I was able to learn how to use the SFML library to render graphics, poll for events such as 
keyboard input, and practice with OOP methods. Additionally, I tried to steer away from the "using namespace" practice
that I was introduced to in early days of C++. Still room for much improvement, but that will hopefully show on
later projects.  

Game Directions:  
Simply use the arrow keys to navigate the snake around the map, collecting fruits (indicated by the green squares), growing in size. You 
can die if you either hit the wall or hit yourself (that is, move the head to hit a part of its tail). This of course grows in difficulty 
as the length of the game goes on because the snake will grow larger and larger in size. The objective of this particular game is to 
collect enough fruits for the snake to be "full" (in this case, the snake will grow to be of length 100), in which case the player will 
win the game.
