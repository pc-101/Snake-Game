# Snake-Game 
Currently incomplete, but functional.

- Things to do: 
  - Make snake die if it hits itself
  
Through this project I was able to learn how to use the SFML library to render graphics, poll for events such as 
keyboard input, and practice with OOP methods. Additionally, I tried to steer away from the "using namespace" practice
that I was introduced to in early days of C++. Still room for much improvement, but that will hopefully show on
later projects. 

Here are screenshots of what this project looks like:
